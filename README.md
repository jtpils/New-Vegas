# New-Vegas
I used my creativity to procedurally generate a 3D city in C++ using the OpenGL framework. I used the knowledge from computer aided graphics, namely 3D modeling, geometric transformations, lighting and texturing. The virtual city consists of buildings and streets which were procedurally generated and decorative elements which were imported from internet and procedurally placed in the scene.

You can find the full description of the project in the file "Tema3EGC.pdf".
